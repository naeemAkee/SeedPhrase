# Understanding Seed Phrases (BIP-39)

A **Seed Phrase** (or mnemonic phrase) is a human-readable backup of your walletâ€™s private keys.  
Example: `seed word fill dash kill tore fire nope ...`

## How Seed Phrase Works
1. Generate random entropy
2. Add checksum
3. Convert to 12/24 words
4. Derive seed
5. Generate private/public keys

## Why is it Secure?
- 12 words = 239 million tries on average
- 24 words = trillions of years at current computing power
